# Dropfilter Bot for Discord

Originally created for the [Domaincord Community](https://discord.gg/R6wTYQ9).

A Pro version is coming soon.

## Usage
I'm assuming you already know how to get a bot token and add the bot to your server.

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the appropriate values.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` or use a process manager like [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to keep the bot running across server restarts and automatically restart the bot if it crashes.

**Make sure the bot has access to read and send messages in all channels you want the commands to be used!**
